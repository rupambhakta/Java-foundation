What are the differences between class and object ?

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the characteristics and behavior of a particular type of object. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that has been created and exists in memory at runtime.

Here are some key differences between classes and objects:

    Definition: A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the characteristics and behavior of a particular  type of object, while an object is an instance of a class.

    Memory: A class is stored in the program's memory, while an object is created at runtime and exists in memory while the program is running.

    Variables: A class can have member variables that define the state of the objects created from that class. Objects created from the same class can have different values for these member variables.

    Methods: A class can have member methods that define the behavior of the objects created from that class. Objects created from the same class can invoke these methods with different arguments.

    Inheritance: A class can inherit properties and methods from a parent class, while an object cannot inherit anything from another object.

    Construction: A class can have a constructor method that is called when an object is created from that class. The constructor can initialize the object's member variables.

    Scope: A class can have public, protected, and private member variables and methods, which determine their accessibility from outside the class. Objects can only access public methods and variables.

In summary, a class defines the blueprint or template for creating objects of a particular type, while an object is a specific instance of a class with its own set of values for member variables.
